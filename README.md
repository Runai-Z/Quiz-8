### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

##### These projects serve as examples of **music visualization**, and I intend to incorporate this concept into our project.

##### The outcome I envision is that, when the audience interacts with the pattern, each distinct circle will represent a different piece of music. Upon interaction, the audience will see the selected circle perform a designated animation while hearing the corresponding audio.
##### For example, on a computer, when the mouse hovers over one of the circles, the associated music will play and the animation will be triggered. This approach satisfies the assignment requirements by integrating both interactivity and audio content.


### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

##### This is *Rotating Polygons on the Major Scale* created by **Patt Vira** using p5.js.

##### Vira applied interactive collision detection technology, combining rotating polygons with sound mapping, which can help implement the imaging techniques selected in Part 1.
##### In this code, Vira integrated music so that when the user hovers over the rotating circles, the code triggers visual animations such as color changes and plays specific sounds. By referring to her interactive approach, our group can make each circle in the selected image represent and respond to different music and animations, creating a programmed art piece that allows users to interact with the image on multiple levels.
